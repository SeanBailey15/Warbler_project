1/4/24: 
--Initialized the codebase from downloaded zip

--Created Git repository before doing any work

--Spent time familiarizing myself with the Model

--Spent time learning about the Flask 'g' object and its purpose:
    *stores common data during a request, only "global" within a context* 
    *doesn't store data BETWEEN requests -> use session or database instead!*

--Learned about the before_request decorator:
    *do_logout probably shouldn't be here(?)*

--Learned about the os library:
    *provides functions for interacting with the operating system*
    *os.environ is a mapping object that repr the user's environmental variables*
    *behaves like a dictionary, dict operations can be performed*
    *can be modified but ONLY for the current process where it was assigned, not permanent*

TOTAL TIME TODAY: 2.5 HOURS

1/7/24:
--Worked on Fix Logout step:
    *Changed debug intercepts to false during this process
    *Implemented simple logout using the provided do_logout() function
    *Question from 1/4 about do_logout was unfounded... 
    *Upon reading app.py further, realized before_request will only call functions when the requested route explicitly calls one of the functions it contains.

--Worked on Fix User Profile step:
    *Changed the way "Bio" and "Location" are displayed in detail.html
    *Followed another user, noticed the followed_user card was not displaying their bio correctly
    *Changed the "Bio" in following.html to display correctly
    *Changed div #warbler-hero to include an image from user.header_image_url
        -Had to comment out a portion of styling in styling.css under "User profile"; see comments in that file
        -This change did not affect other users --> FOUND A BUG:
            Had to comment out an API call in /generator/create_csvs.py because it was broken;
            Decided to hardcode the User model default header_image_url into the generator; see comments in /generator/create_csvs.py
        -Regenerated the csv files so it would render a header image for users, then re-seeded

--Fix User Cards step:
    *Already fixed the html for following.html in the previous step
    *Fixed html in followers.html and index.html to display the Bios correctly
