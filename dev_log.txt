1/4/24: 
--Initialized the codebase from downloaded zip
--Created Git repository before doing any work
--Spent time familiarizing myself with the Model
--Spent time learning about the Flask 'g' object and its purpose:
    *stores common data during a request, only "global" within a context* 
    *doesn't store data BETWEEN requests -> use session or database instead!*
--Learned about the before_request decorator:
    *do_logout probably shouldn't be here(?)*
--Learned about the os library:
    *provides functions for interacting with the operating system*
    *os.environ is a mapping object that repr the user's environmental variables*
    *behaves like a dictionary, dict operations can be performed*
    *can be modified but ONLY for the current process where it was assigned, not permanent*
